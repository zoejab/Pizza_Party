# Pizza Party

View the Website here: https://secret-everglades-7191.herokuapp.com/pizza_places

- Technologies Used
  - html, css, ruby, rails

- Approach Taken:
  - A website similar to Yelp - but on a smaller scale and only for pizza!
  - used the basic rails scaffold to build the website.
  - authenticated users for individual sessions

- Unsolved Problems
  - security in regards to user sessions - you can access any profile by route users/id
  - anyone - as long as you are logged in to any account - can delete an account
  - when you sign up and have an error message appear (as in you put in a nonqualifying password) the form to login has CSS Problems
